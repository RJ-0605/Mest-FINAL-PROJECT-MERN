	 //test to get already generated courses displayed
	 
	 http://localhost:3000/studentphase/returnsubjectsdetailsfor-userId
	 
	 
	 new procedure 
	 
	 
	(1) first add users
	 
	 // testing  users 

{ 
		
	"email"       : "kayd@gmail.com",
	"firstname"   : "kayda",
	"lastname"    : "brazo",
	"gender"      : "female",

	 "age"        : 39       ,
	 "password"    : "butch"  
	 
	 }

	 
	 (2) add these course selections for user in userselections
	 
	    a. AI does it the python path 
	    
	    
	    b. or i can manually do it as an admin like this with postman for now 
	     
	     http://localhost:5000/tests/userselections
	     
	     {
    "message": {
        "suggested_subject_codes": [
            34,
            75,
            2
        ],
        "added_subjects_code": [],
        "_id": "5fe27a49fe1ea88990ae9601",
        "userId": "5fe265782bdc7676e6b4ab36",
        "__v": 0
    }
}
	 
	 
	 (3)  Try to display some subjects based on userId
	 
	  well done 
	 
	 (4) next thing is to add new subjects
	 
			{ 
				"title"              :  "English" , 	
				"subject_code"       : 4 ,
				"students_count"     : 2 ,
				"teachers_count"     : 4 
					 
				 }
	 
	 
	 (5) connect python api on Home so home does course selection  that with use effect before we get to  student dashboard
	 
	 well done its done the hoe route handles the python part 
	 
	 
	 
	 (6) Also taken care so the home route doesnt generate more subjects or hit the python api just because the user exists i also check if the users subjects has already been generated 
	 
	 
	 (7) Design figma 
	 
	 (8) Add and subtract courses 
	 
	 (9) final Post after changes
